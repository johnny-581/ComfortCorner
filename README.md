## Inspiration

When one feel depressed, what can be more conforting then unexpectedly recieving a short and warm message of encouragement? We designed the confort corner website centered around this idea. There is a large clickable insperational quote front and center on the home page we made it the first thing the user would see when they visite the website.

## What it does

It provides resources for UBC students experiencing mental health issues.

## Challenges we ran into

Collaborating on GitHub was quite difficult, and it took us quite a while to became good at it. Furthermore, none of us had proior experience with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Learning these languages as we built our website was both a stressful and enjoyable experience.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud to have a fully functioning website with multiple features such as the comfort bot and the clickable inspriational quote. We are also proud to have become a better web developer through this process.

## What we learned

We learned how the front-end and back-end works together to create a interactive website using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. We understood the basics and intricacies of how these languages work in tandem to provide the user experience.

## What's next for comfort corner

We aim to improve the accuracy of our comfort bot to better aid students in their day-to-day life, perhaps preserving a chat history, and adding the ability to login to accounts.
